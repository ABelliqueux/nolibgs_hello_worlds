# STP : Semi-Transparency usage

This example shows the various way of converting an image with transparency to a TIM and use it in code.  
It also shows the effect of activating Semi-Transparency on a primitive textured with those images.  

Use the `SELECT` button to switch primitive semi-transparency on and off.  

It also features a few C struct to facilitate access to the TIM file / pixel data.

See [https://github.com/ABelliqueux/nolibgs_hello_worlds/wiki/STP](https://github.com/ABelliqueux/nolibgs_hello_worlds/wiki/STP) for more information on how to convert your images to TIM while preserving transparency.
